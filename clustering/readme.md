## Grouping Wine Sales Customers through Unsupervised Clustering

The assignment uses a small dataset of customers' responses to wine sales promotions to try and group customers by the buying preferences.
It demonstrates a technique that is useful for businesses in segmenting their markets to do targetted marketing.

The assignment demonstrates different ways of assessing performance on several different clustering methods. However, the results repeatedly
report that no clustering can be found in this data, either due to the small data size or a true lack of clustering among
the customers' buying habits.
