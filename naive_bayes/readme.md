## Basic Natural Language Processing using Naive Bayes

This project demonstrates the use of the "Bag of Words" technique for measuring positive and negative sentiment in movie reviews.
Data is from move reivews on Rotten Tomatoes and words are trained by whether or not the critique identified the move as 'fresh' or not.

The assignment has limited success in predicting the freshness rating of new reviews, showing the limits of the bag of words technique
as a way of discerning sentiment when words are viewed individually (1-grams).
