The purpose of this assignment was to gain practice in using machine learning-oriented applications of logistic regression
for data classification. The exercise attempts to classify individuals by gender, using 2 features, height and weight.
The practical purpose to practice using cross-validation techniques, focusing on `sklearn`'s `GridSearchCV`, for parameter selection.
I also considered the use `sklearn`'s `LogisticRegressionCV`, which seemed particularly relevant as it is built to do cross validation
with logistic regression analyses.
