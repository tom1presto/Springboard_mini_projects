## Springboard Machine Learning: Linear Regression

The purpose of this assignment is to obtain practice implementing different standard linear regression (OLS) techniques in
Python and to gain exposure to supervised learning techniques and regression using training/validation/testing data splits.
It asks several questions regarding how to present data using Python/_Seaborn_, _stats_models_, and _sklearn_.

The project is contained in the IPyNotebook: `Scheinert Linear Regression Miniproject 13sep17.ipynb`

The project's progression and logic should be clear in the notebook from text and code comments.
