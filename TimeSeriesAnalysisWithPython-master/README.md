# Time Series Analysis with Python

The files here cover Springboard's mini-project for time series analysis in Python.
The original files and instructions are on Github: https://github.com/AileenNielsen/TimeSeriesAnalysisWithPython
Look for those files included in the .zip file that is posted in that repository.

The presentation and notebooks are by Ailen Nielsen and presented at SciPy 2016.
The video can be viewed on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=6577&v=JNfxr4BQrLk

`TimeSeriesAnalysisWithPython.pdf` and the associated YouTube video lay out the process of this project. The assignment is spread across the first 7
IPyNotebooks (.ipynb) contained in this repository (#'s 0-6).
Step through the notebooks in sequence to view the whole assignment while following along with the presentation contained in the `.pdf` file
and presented in the YouTube video. At a later date, I intend to return and complete notebooks 7-12.
