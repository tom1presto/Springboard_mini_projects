    "_Reply:_ Logically, the two are analogous to disaggregating and aggregating, repectively. Changing to a lower frequency is essentially pooling your existing data. In this case, you can now look into interpolation between data points to fill in data or to backfill your data from future points, since that time is now part of the less frequent sampling times. This was how you pushed future data into the past when going to a higher frequency but is appropriate when going to a lower frequency."
