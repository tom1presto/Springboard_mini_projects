## Building a Recommender System for Movie Recommendations

This assignment is taken from a 2015 PyCon presentation that demonstrated how to build a recommender system.
It uses data from MovieLens to build the system and make predictions.

The assignment is in three parts. The first two provide a basic review of dataframe mananagment using the pandas
package. The third section builds the recommender system, labeled as the 'Mini-Challenge'.

The assignment is contained in the `Scheinert answers to questions 24Oct17` IPyNotebook.

In the assignment, I make references to code and processes from the presentation. The `pycon` notebook was used in
the PyCon presentation upon which the assignment was based. It was provided as part of the assignment for reference.
Those code chunks and processes that I reference as being from the presentation can be viewed in the `pycon` notebook.
