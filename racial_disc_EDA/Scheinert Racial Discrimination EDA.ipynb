    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "Race and callback status are categorical variables. Proving a relationship requires a different technique that using common correlation coefficients. The standard technique for proving a relationship is to use a contingency table, often refered to as a crosstabulation or crosstab, and calculate a Chi-square ($X^2$) statistic for use in testing for statistical significance. If the statistic is statistically significant, then you can conclude that the values of the two variables in the table are dependent upon each other. In this context, a statistically significant result would indicate that receiving a call back from a potentially employer is dependent on have a white-sounding name.\n",

    "The CLT is primarily applied to sampling distribution statistics, particularly when the distribution of the underlying random variable is normally distributed. But, since it applies to sampling statistics, it remains relevant even when the underlying distribution cannot be normally distributed, as in the categorical and binary variables used in this analysis.\n",

    "$X^2$ distributions are bounded at 0 and have a tail that approaches the x-axis, the larger the x value is. Tests using a $X^2$ distribution use a one-way test, requiring higher values to prove statistical significance. As a result, there is one critical value, rather than a broader confidence interval that encapsulates a margin of error for an estimate. I will calculate this critical value instead of a margin of error and confidence interval. This result is then compared with the $X^2$ statistic calculated above."

It is also not clear if the racial appearance of the name is the most important factor, and, indeed, one at least hopes that it is not. The low rate of callback for all individuals in the survey does suggest that some other factor(s) may be more important. Additional independent variables and linear regression is likely the best tool to further explore the relationship between the racial appearance of an applicant's name and that applicant's likelihood of receiving a callback.\n",

    "Nevertheless, the fundamental research question of this analysis, and the reason for gathering this data, was to determine if race impacts an applicant's chance of receiving a callback. The contingency table results, if all the other potential factors have been properly controlled in the survey sample, should be sufficient for drawing general conclusions. And these conclusions  indicate that an applicant's race is a factor in determining whether or not the applicant receives a callback from a potential employer."
